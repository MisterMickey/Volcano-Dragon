Hi there! I'm an aspiring software developer who loves to learn new technology. As a kid, I was interested in technology, especially computers. When I was in 4th Grade. I learned Microsoft PowerPoint and made my first PowerPoint slide on "Computer input/output devices", From that day I started my journey of learning new technologies and working on them.

I'm more inclined toward technology, When I joined ATAL tinkering labs as a student in my 9th Grade. I love spending time in the schoolâ€™s computer lab and helping classmates with their computer challenges and programming-related questions. I have strong technical skills, particularly in software development and problem analysis. I enjoy solving real-world problems in an effective and creative way using technology.
